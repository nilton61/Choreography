# Understanding Non-Blocking Code: Why Choreography Matters

## The Problem with Blocking Code

Blocking code, like Arduino's infamous `delay()` function, stops your entire program while waiting for time to pass. This seemingly simple approach has severe limitations:

- Your microcontroller can't do anything else during that waiting time
- Multiple tasks can't run concurrently 
- Input events might be missed entirely
- Complex timing requirements become nearly impossible to implement
- Code becomes difficult to maintain as project complexity grows

## The Blink Without Delay Pattern

The Arduino community eventually recognized these issues and developed the "Blink Without Delay" pattern, which:

- Uses `millis()` to track time without stopping program execution
- Allows the program to continue running while still handling timing
- Requires more initial setup but enables dramatically more capable programs

## State Machines: A Better Approach

State machines offer a structured way to manage program flow:

- Programs are organized as distinct states with clear transitions
- Each state handles specific behaviors and conditions
- Multiple state machines can run independently
- Complex behavior emerges from simple, maintainable components

## How Choreography Simplifies Everything

Choreography builds on these principles to provide:

- An intuitive dance-inspired syntax that makes state machines accessible
- Built-in timing functions that eliminate boilerplate code
- A framework that inherently encourages good non-blocking practices
- Simple ways to create parallel processes without heavy threading or RTOS

## Examples: Blocking vs. Non-Blocking

[This section would include concrete examples showing the transformation from blocking to non-blocking code, with Choreography examples]

## Best Practices for Non-Blocking Design

- Keep state functions short and focused
- Avoid any functions that block execution
- Use state transitions to break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Design with concurrency in mind from the beginning

## Conclusion

By embracing non-blocking design patterns and tools like Choreography, you can create more robust, responsive, and complex applications on resource-constrained platforms.
