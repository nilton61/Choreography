## Theoretical Background

Choreography is built on the mathematical foundation of finite state machines (FSM), a concept from abstract algebra and formal language theory.

### Classical FSM Definition vs Choreography Implementation

Classical finite state machines are formally defined as a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) where:

1. **Q**: A finite set of states
   - In Choreography, each `stance` function represents a state

2. **Σ**: A finite set of input symbols
   - Choreography stances can flexibly handle any inputs they need to examine

3. **δ**: A transition function that takes a state and input symbol and returns a new state
   - Each stance determines its own transitions using `quickstep` or `sequence` calls

4. **q0**: An initial state
   - Set by the constructor when you create a Choreography instance

5. **F**: A set of accept (final) states
   - Represented by stances that don't transition to other states

While maintaining the mathematical robustness of traditional state machines, Choreography offers enhanced flexibility by:

- Encapsulating state-specific logic in separate functions. Each state is represented by a function of type stance which i solely respoansible for both processing its own input and managing the transitions to other functions
- Allowing complex transition conditions beyond simple input symbols
- Providing timing-based transitions through the `sequence` method
- Supporting initialization routines via the `passodoble` function as well as an overloaded version of `sequence` adding time intervalls to passodoble
   - The use of initialisation routines is very common. A good example would be the `setup` and `loop` functionality of the Arduino framework itself. But this is useful in many places, like updating counters and displaus, sending messages and other places where a single action is needed.
   - Also the use of timekeeping is crucial in control systems. Choreography has the abilty to keep track of the time spent in a state with the `timeInStance` function as well as initiating timed state transitions with the`sequence` functions

This approach results in more readable, maintainable code while preserving the power of the formal state machine model.
